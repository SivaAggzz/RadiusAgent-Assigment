can select any one option from each facility. Display name and icon. For Example,
i) Property Type : Apartment, Condo, Boat House, Land - User can select only one
among this

b) Add the exclusion list by extending the above UI, so that users aren't able to select
from the exclusions combinations.

Ex. 1 : Property Type : Land, Number of Rooms: 1 to 3 rooms.
Ex. 2 : Property Type : Boat House, Other Facilities : Garage

c) Use Core Data to Persist the data, so every time you load data from the DB, and refresh
your DB from API once a day.
